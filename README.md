Version 1 was created with HTML, CSS3 and javascript. It was riddled with bugs and features that I never got to properly implement.

Version 2 of that project. Through this version I wanted to learn more about DOM manipulation and Sass as well. 

This is currently version 3. As I currently working with jQuery at my workplace. I wanted to remake and improve this project using jQuery.
